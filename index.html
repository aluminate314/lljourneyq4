    <h1>Our Journey</h1>
</section>
<br><br><br>
<section class="hidden">
    <p>Our YouTube channel was first established on Nov. 17, 2022. It was a group<br>
        decision to choose a podcast as our category as the idea of it appealed to<br>
        us the most. From then on, we brainstormed for our branding, our intro video,<br>
        and our future possible topics.<br>
    </p>
    </section>
    <br><br><br>
<section class="hidden">
    <p>A month after the creation of our channel (on Dec. 9), we launched our first<br>
        video which was our short intro video that we will be using at the beginning<br>
        of all our videos as much as possible.<br>

<section class="hidden">
    <p>Then on Mar. 17, 2023, we launched our second video which focused more on<br>
        introducing what our channel was all about. Although it seems like a short<br>
        and simple video, we planned and thought about its contents carefully and<br>
        created a storyboard for it ot remain organized.<br>
        <br>
        This video included our mission, goals, what we do, etc.<br>

    <p>
        For our last school quarter, we decided to post a podcast to start off our<br>
        podcasting career. We chose the topic of digital art tips as everyone in<br>
        our group has had some experience with it, thus making it easier to give<br>
        tips from the heart.<br>

<br><br><br>
<section class="hidden">
    <p>
        Throughout the quarter, we were able to advertise our brand through posting<br>
        in our social media that we created after posting our second video.<br>

</section>
<br><br><br>
<section class="hidden">
    <p>
        We can say that our advertising were effective for we observed an increase in<br>
        subscribers and in views, amassing a total of 160+ views based from our<br>
        statistics.

    <h1>Key takeaways from Q1-Q4</h1>
</section>
<br><br><br>
<section class="hidden">
    <h2>Quarter 1 || Jelce and Sharico says...</h2>
    <p>
        What I learned in Life Labs during quarter 1 was different types of content people<br>
        had to offer such as; podcasts, educational videos, tutorial videos, etc.. I also<br>
        learned more about basic research stuff and basic scripts in Javascript. I was also<br>
        introduced to different types of audiences and what audience we should target based on<br>
        our content.<br>
        <br><br>
        From what I learned from Q1, I have learned about the basic content in Youtube. Like<br>
        the types of youtube's video and how they differentiate for other videos, and their<br>
        purpose on why they are uploaded in the platform, like if they are for entertainment<br>
        purposes, educational, or assistance. I as well learn about how to research efficiently<br>
        and effectively so we can have the most out of our research.<br>
    </p>

<section class="hidden">
    <h2> Quarter 2 || Zoe and Mischa says...</h2>
    <p>
        What I learned in Life Labs during quarter 2 was; how to create a plan and building your<br>
        online brand{ Choosing look for your brand, Designing a logo, Creating a tagline}, alongside<br>
        with how to make your website interactive using javascript different types of elements,<br>
        how to make it accessible and active for your viewers, ect..<br>
        <br><br>
        What I have learned in Life Labs during Quarter 2 was, from what I recall, using different<br>
        interactive elements using JavaScript to make your website more functional and make it look<br>
        more appealing to the eyes.<br>

<section class="hidden">
    <h2>Quarter 3 || Hilary says...</h2>
    <p>
        Quarter 3 focused more on content creating more than anything as we surfed through the<br>
        following topics: planning for the first video (EG25), creating the video (EG16-17), editing<br>
        the video (EG18-20), and lastly, uploading and advertising the said video publicly in<br>
        YouTube. During this time, I was able to expand my knowledge not only academically, but<br>
        also realizations to myself.<br>
        <br><br>
        I became more aware about the risks and dangers of the internet, and why we need to be<br>
        cautious on what we do and publish in public to avoid oversharing and unwanted issues. I<br>
        was also able to relearn the importance of storyboards, as it greatly helped me with my<br>
        organization. Another thing that helped me become organized is learning about the video<br>
        production process, as it guided me on the steps I will have to take next in order to plan<br>
        for my videos. I pretty much had knowledge already when it came to editing and advertising,<br>
        though the materials for it were also good references. Not only that, advertising our<br>
        channel publicly has made me push myself out of my comfort zone and taught me  how to become<br>
        more confident.<br>

    <h1>Quarter 4 || Zoe and Mischa says...</h1>
    <p>
        What I learned in Life Labs quarter 4 was, how to analyze your youtube videos analytics<br>
        to enhance and improve your performance.<br>
        <br><br><br>
        What I have learned in Life Labs Quarter 4 was on how to analyze the results from the<br>
        video we have made, I also gained experience on my communication skills with people as well<br>
        as my/our confidence.<br>

    <h1>Some thoughts and opinions</h1>
    <p>
        It's been a whole school year. There was a lot of up and downs not only when it comes to<br>
        this subject but also to the others. Brainstorming and recording was a time consuming<br>
        process, but the memories created along the way were what made it worth it all. This<br>
        experience has helped us improve our creativity, and collaboration. Not only that, it<br>
        it encouraged us to go out of our comfort zone to be more confident. And we, Group 2, are<br>
        thankful for all the things that has been taught to us along the way.<br>
